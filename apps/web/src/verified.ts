/**
 * Drops Cloak vouches for: listed by the Cloak team, or reviewed and approved. They get a check mark on the drop
 * list and the drop page. Anyone can create a drop, so the mark is the only thing telling a real partner sale from a
 * copy with the same name and art.
 *
 * Two ways in, both read at build time:
 *   - a creator wallet (the team's): every drop it creates is verified;
 *   - a drop address: one approved drop, made by anyone.
 * Add to the lists below, or set VITE_VERIFIED_CREATORS / VITE_VERIFIED_DROPS (comma-separated) in the host's settings.
